            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This amazing caramel apple recipe was given to me by a close friend when I was searching for a recipe to 
            make homemade caramel apples for the very first time. My family and friends loved these delicious treats! 
            Sprinkle with nuts, crushed cookies, or whatever you desire while the caramel is still warm, 
            but work quickly as the caramel sets very fast.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>8 large tart apples</li>
                <li>8 wooden chopsticks for handles</li>
                <li>2 cups packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>1 cup light corn syrup</li>
                <li>1 cup butter</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Remove any wax from apples to help caramel stick better: Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Dip apples in boiling water for a few seconds, using a slotted spoon, then dry with paper towels to remove any wax from the peels. Set apples aside to cool completely, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Insert sticks into the bottom of each cooled apple through the core for a handle.</li>
                <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir brown sugar, sweetened condensed milk, corn syrup, and butter together in a saucepan over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then reduce heat to medium. Cook until a candy thermometer reads 248 degrees F (120 degrees C), stirring constantly to prevent burning, about 25 to 30 minutes. A teaspoon of caramel dropped in a glass of cold water, should form a firm ball.</li>
                <li>Remove caramel from heat and stir in vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>Working quickly, dip each apple into the hot caramel to completely coat the apple and about 1/2 inch of the wooden handle.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle apples with any desired toppings while still hot.</li>
                <li>Let caramel apples cool on the prepared baking sheet, about 1 hour. Use caution, caramel is very hot.</li>
            </ol>
